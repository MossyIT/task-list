# task-list
Background:
  This project is based in an assignment given by the CS162 course at PCC.
Function:
  The goal of this project is to display a menu in which you may manipulate
  a list of tasks to your liking.
Skills:
  In this rendition of the project, the focus is OOP through classes such as 
  Task and Tasklist, and mananging memory allocation via the heap instead of
  the stack. Eventually, the focus will shift to linked lists.
